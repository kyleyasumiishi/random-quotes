Implementation Notes/Ideas/Steps:

keep track of previous quotes in state and add function to go back
update newQuote to add previous quote to state
randomly choose a new quote when components load, not just my quote every time
add twitter and facebook functionality
add hyperlink to each author to wikipedia page
start designing (also need to add quotation marks around quote and hyphen before author's name)
clean up folders
comment code - maybe explore linter

Do stuff with later:

passionately curious
eslint
