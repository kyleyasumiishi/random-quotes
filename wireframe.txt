Implementation Notes/Ideas/Steps:

keep track of previous quotes in state and add function to go back - DONE
when go forward, go until most recent quote - DONE
update newQuote to add previous quote to state - DONE



randomly choose a new quote when components load, not just my quote every time
add twitter and facebook functionality
add hyperlink to each author to wikipedia page
start designing (also need to add quotation marks around quote and hyphen before author's name)
clean up folders
comment code - maybe explore linter

Do stuff with later:

passionately curious
eslint
lifecycle




previous state
-when newquote is added, the existing quote goes into an array maybe?
-when back button is clicked
  I don't think the previous array should be modified. I think if you go back, there should be a separate state property like numPrevious that keeps track of how far you went back. So if you go back 1, it's length - 1
-when forward button is clicked
  First checks if numPrevious is greater than 0. If it is then it decreases numPrevious and displays the object at that reverse position in the previous array. If numPrevious is 0, it calls newQuote
