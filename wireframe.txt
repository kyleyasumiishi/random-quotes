Implementation Notes/Ideas/Steps:

0. Write a hello world test - Done
1. Create a QuoteBox Component
2. Start tests for App Component

// This will be a child Component
// Does this component need to know state or can it be a function component and receive props from parent. I think latter.

// Hierarchy of components
App 
QuoteBox, Back, Forward (same component for forward arrow and button)
Social Media

// List of quote objects
// Each object will contain text, author, color info, etc.
