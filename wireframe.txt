Implementation Notes/Ideas/Steps:

when the new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the text element

state in App
-current quote
-previous quotes

function in App - get new quote
will be called when component loads and whenever button or forward arrow is clicked

add current quote to state













Do stuff with later:

passionately curious
eslint
