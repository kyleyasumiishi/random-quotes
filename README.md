## Lessons Learned

One of my primary goals for each freeCodeCamp project and set of challenges is to learn about new web development concepts and practice my programming skills.

Here are a few <em>new concepts</em> I learned and practiced by creating this React app:

* Test-Driven Development
* Unit testing in React with Jest, Enzyme, and react-testing-library
* Wireframing
* Mobile-first design
* Readme-Driven Development
* Creating a new React app with <code>create-react-app</code>
* Differences between Yarn and npm
* JavaScript <code>import</code> statement
* React components and props
* Separation of concerns as a basic design principle for separating my software's logic into different sections
* Understanding the reason for binding <code>this</code> in the constructor to class methods
* CSS position property
* Deploying React apps to GitHub pages

## Technologies Used
